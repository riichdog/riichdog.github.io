    <p>Hey whats up, thank you for stopping by my website. My name is Richie Eaddie and I made this portfolio for my current 
        web development class. To be honest I never know what to write about when writing about myself. I just end up just rambling
    on about random aspects of my life, and honestly it never ends up being a fluid paragraph. So naturally, of course, thats what I 
will be doing for this website </p>

    <p> I'm currently studying computer science with an intent to minor in mathematics. I'm rather excited to be a CS major
        because it gives me the opportunity to express my creativity through coding and potientially create beutiful websites or extensive video games.
    I am eager to learn more about my major because the possibilities that are possible through it's principles are endless. ok but do the 
instructors actually read this, I just wanna let you know that im really bad at writing about myself. Although I have a rather 
technical major, I actually produce beats as a hobby. It's a great way to relax and releive any stress from the day. As of now its 
just a hobby, but tbh I wouldn't blowing then becoming famous then acting like i dont know nobody. </p>
