                <p>The first homework assignment for CSSE280 tasked us with creating a simple webapp that allowed you to
                    pick your favorite number by incrementing or decreasing a counter that was displayed on the screen.
                    Extra functionality was
                    added that allows for the number to be reset to 0 at anytime to ease the users experience. You can
                    also choose your relative favorite color because, well, there are only 4 colors to choose from, but
                    nonetheless still impressive
                    due to the interactive aspect of the color being displayed once clicked. </p>

                <p>For one of the "Follow Along" videos in CSSE280 we were instructed to build a Tic-Tac-Toe webapp.
                    This was a rather interesting project because it exposed me to more of the javascript/css aspect of
                    building a website. We learned how to manipulate and represent CSS code within a javascript file. An
                    intresting aspect
                    about this webapp is that you can reset the board at anytime by using the "New Game" button in the
                    bottom right </p>

                <img src="images/portfolio/linearlightsout.png">
                <p>This is another game-based webapp, except this time it was a homework assignment where we tested what
                    we learned from the "Tic-Tac-Toe" Follow Along.
                    It was interesting being let out into the wild and being forced to fend for myself, although it was
                    not as bad as I make it sound. I was able to use my
                    knowledge on different frameworks in conjuction with my experience in html/css/javascript to conquer
                    this assingment. </p>
